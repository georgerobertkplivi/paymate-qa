# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the test strategy for the Paymate QA Automation Framework, covering UI, API, and performance testing using Playwright, K6, Allure, and GitHub Actions.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure high product quality through automated regression, functional, and performance testing.
- Provide fast feedback to development via CI/CD.
- Maintain traceability and transparency with reporting and test case management.

## 3. Scope
- UI Automation: Web application flows (registration, login, etc.)
- API Automation: REST API endpoints
- Performance: Key user journeys and APIs
- Reporting: Allure
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## 4. Test Approach
- **UI Tests:** Playwright with Page Object Model (POM) in TypeScript
- **API Tests:** Playwright APIRequestContext in TypeScript
- **Performance:** K6 in TypeScript
- **Data:** Randomized via Faker, managed in data classes
- **Reporting:** Allure for all test types
- **Execution:** Shell scripts for modular test runs

## 5. Test Levels & Types
- Smoke, Regression, Functional, Negative, Performance
- Automated and data-driven

## 6. Test Data Management
- Random data generated via Faker
- Data classes per test type
- No sensitive/real user data

## 7. Defect Management
- Defects logged in project management tool (Jira/GitHub Issues)
- Linked to failed test cases

## 8. Reporting
- Allure reports generated and opened after each run
- CI/CD artifacts for historical runs

## 9. CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: Install, test, report, artifact
- Branch protection and PR checks

## 10. Quality Metrics
- Test coverage, pass rate, defect density, performance thresholds

## 11. Exit Criteria
- All critical tests pass
- No open critical defects
- Performance within SLAs

## 12. Maintenance
- Modular code, reusable data, regular review
- Linting and formatting enforced
